# Welcome to the dwyl website 2.0

This is a simpler and revamped version of the [original dwyl website](https://github.com/dwyl/dwyl-site). Meant to serve as a scrolling experience, this version adds 3D scenes, scrubbing animations and a minimalistic aesthetic. 

You can find the original design prototype in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/GDHHJkPqrmzCQBOSLn1RAN/DWYL?node-id=0%3A1).

## Technology

The website is developed with Typescript and React. [Spline](https://spline.design/) is used on 3D scenes and [Gsap with Scrolltrigger](https://greensock.com/gsap/) for animations. [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) is used to style the page. 

The website is bundled and served using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)
